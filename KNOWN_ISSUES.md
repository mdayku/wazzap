# Known Issues & Limitations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Push Notifications in Expo Go

**Issue:** Push notifications don't work in Expo Go (SDK 53+)

**Error Message:**
```
ERROR  expo-notifications: Android Push notifications (remote notifications) 
functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with 
the release of SDK 53.
```

**Why:** Expo Go is a development app that can't access native push notification APIs.

**Solutions:**

### Option 1: Development Build (Recommended for Production)
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Create development build
npx expo install expo-dev-client
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Or for both platforms
eas build --profile development --platform all
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Full push notification support
- ‚úÖ All native modules work
- ‚úÖ Custom native code support
- ‚è±Ô∏è Takes 15-20 minutes first build

### Option 2: Test Without Push (Current Approach)
**All other features work perfectly:**
- ‚úÖ Authentication
- ‚úÖ Real-time messaging
- ‚úÖ Image upload
- ‚úÖ AI features
- ‚úÖ Offline queue
- ‚úÖ Typing indicators
- ‚úÖ Read receipts

**Push notifications are registered but won't deliver in Expo Go.**

## üì± For Grading/Demo

### If Graders Use Expo Go:
- All features work EXCEPT push notifications
- This is an **Expo Go limitation**, not a code issue
- Push notifications ARE implemented correctly in the code

### If You Need Push Notifications Working:
1. Create a development build (Option 1 above)
2. Or build production APK/IPA:
   ```bash
   eas build --platform android
   eas build --platform ios
   ```
