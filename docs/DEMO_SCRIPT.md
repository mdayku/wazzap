## 🎤 Backup Talking Points (If Questions Arise)

### "How does semantic search work?"
> "I use OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model to generate vector embeddings for each message. When you search, your query is also embedded, and I use cosine similarity to find the most relevant messages by meaning, not just keyword matching. The embeddings are stored in Firestore and queried via Cloud Functions."

### "What happens when you're offline?"
> "Messages are queued in an optimistic UI state and stored locally. When you reconnect, the queue flushes automatically and syncs with Firestore. I've implemented a fast reconnect service that gets you back online in under a second, even after a 30-second network drop. The app also shows a persistent sync banner so you always know your connection status."

### "How do you handle AI costs?"
> "I use GPT-4o-mini which is 60x cheaper than GPT-4. For a moderate user base, AI costs are around $10-20/month. I've also implemented caching - summaries are stored in Firestore so you don't regenerate them every time. For production, I'd add rate limiting per user and offer AI features as a premium tier."

### "Why React Native instead of native?"
> "React Native with Expo gives me cross-platform development (iOS + Android) with a single codebase, which is perfect for an MVP. I get 90% of native performance with 50% of the development time. For features like camera, audio, and haptics, Expo provides excellent native modules. If I needed more performance, I could always eject to bare React Native or write native modules."

### "How do you ensure message ordering?"
> "I use Firestore's server-side timestamps (serverTimestamp()) which are authoritative and consistent across all clients. Messages are ordered by createdAt in the query, and I've built a load test that sends 20 messages rapidly to prove they always arrive in the correct order. The p50 latency is under 200ms."

### "What's your testing strategy?"
> "I have a three-tier testing approach:
> 1. **Unit tests** - 53 passing tests for components, hooks, and utilities using Jest
> 2. **Manual tests** - 65+ test scenarios documented, including force-quit, reinstall, and cross-device sync
> 3. **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions pipeline that runs lint and typecheck on every push to main
> 
> I've also implemented a LoadTest screen that measures real-world performance metrics."
