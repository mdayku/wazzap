## LinkedIn Post (Longer Format)

```
🎉 Excited to share my submission for Gauntlet AI Week 2: MessageAI!

I built a real-time chat application that makes team communication 10x more productive with AI.

🔥 Key Features:
• Real-time messaging with sub-400ms delivery
• AI-powered thread summarization (GPT-4o-mini)
• Automatic action item extraction
• Semantic search using OpenAI embeddings
• Priority detection for urgent messages
• Decision tracking and context preservation

💡 The Problem:
Remote teams drown in chat messages. Context gets lost. Action items fall through the cracks. Decisions are buried in history.

✅ The Solution:
MessageAI uses AI to make conversations actionable. One tap to summarize any thread. Auto-extract tasks with assignees and due dates. Search by meaning, not just keywords.

📊 Performance:
• 53 passing unit tests
• 65+ manual test scenarios
• <1s reconnect after network drop
• 92ms/message throughput
• 94% force-quit test pass rate

🛠️ Tech Stack:
• React Native + Expo
• Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Functions, Storage)
• OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini, text-embedding-3-small)
• TypeScript, GitHub Actions CI/CD

This was an intense 2-week sprint, and I'm proud of what I built. The app is fully functional on physical devices and ready for demo.

Huge thanks to @GauntletAI for the opportunity to push my limits!

- Video editor (CapCut or iMovie)

### Recording Steps:

1. **Set up devices:**
   - Clean home screen
   - Full brightness
   - Hide status bar if possible
   - Position side-by-side for Scene 1

2. **Record each scene separately:**
   - Scene 1: 5-second clip of message send/receive
   - Scene 2: 5-second clip of AI menu opening
   - Scene 3: 5-second clip of summarization
   - Scene 4: 5-second clip of action items
   - Scene 5: 5-second clip of load test

3. **Edit in CapCut:**
   - Trim each clip to 3 seconds
   - Add text overlays (white text, black background, 50% opacity)
   - Add transitions (0.3s fade)
   - Speed up loading animations (1.5x)
   - Add end card with logo

4. **Export:**
   - 1080x1920 (vertical) or 1920x1080 (horizontal)
   - 30 FPS
   - MP4 format

5. **Convert to GIF:**
   - Upload to ezgif.com
   - Optimize: reduce colors to 128, lossy compression 30
   - Target file size: <5MB for Twitter, <10MB for LinkedIn

### Text Overlay Timing:
- 0-3s: "Real-time chat"
- 3-6s: "5 AI features"
- 6-9s: "Auto-summarize"
- 9-12s: "Extract tasks"
- 12-15s: "Built for speed"
