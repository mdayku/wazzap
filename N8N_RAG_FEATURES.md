## 🔄 n8n Workflow Automation Features

### What is n8n?
n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that connects apps and services. For MessageAI, it enables powerful integrations and automated workflows.

### Phase 1: Core n8n Integrations (High Priority - 15h)

| Feature | Description | Priority | Effort |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Slack Integration** | Auto-forward high-priority messages to Slack | High | 3h |
| **Email Notifications** | Send email summaries of missed messages | High | 2h |
| **Webhook Triggers** | Trigger workflows on specific message events | High | 3h |
| **Calendar Integration** | Create calendar events from meeting mentions | High | 4h |
| **Task Management** | Auto-create tasks in Trello/Asana from action items | Medium | 3h |

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Example: n8n webhook endpoint
POST /api/n8n/webhook
{
  "event": "high_priority_message",
  "messageId": "...",
  "threadId": "...",
  "content": "..."
}
```

**Benefits for Grading:**
- ✅ Shows integration capabilities
- ✅ Demonstrates understanding of webhooks
- ✅ Real-world business value
- ✅ Workflow automation mastery

## 🧠 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Features

### What is RAG?
RAG combines retrieval of relevant information from a knowledge base with AI generation to produce context-aware, accurate responses.

### Phase 1: RAG-Powered AI Assistant (High Priority - 20h)

| Feature | Description | Priority | Effort |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Conversational Memory** | AI remembers past conversations in context | High | 5h |
| **Team Knowledge Base** | Query past decisions/discussions via AI | High | 6h |
| **Smart Search** | Enhanced semantic search with RAG | High | 4h |
| **Context-Aware Summaries** | Summaries that reference related threads | High | 5h |

**Architecture:**
```
User Query
    ↓
Vector Search (Embeddings)
    ↓
Retrieve Top-K Relevant Messages
    ↓
Combine with Current Context
    ↓
GPT-4 Generation
    ↓
Context-Aware Response
```

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Vector Database**: Use existing Firestore embeddings
2. **Retrieval**: Semantic search across message history
3. **Augmentation**: Add retrieved context to GPT prompt
4. **Generation**: GPT-4 generates response with full context

**Example Use Cases:**
- "What did we decide about the API design last week?"
- "Summarize all mentions of Project X"
- "What are the open action items for Alice?"

**Benefits for Grading:**
- ✅ Demonstrates RAG understanding
- ✅ Advanced AI/ML application
- ✅ Practical enterprise use case
- ✅ Leverages existing semantic search infrastructure

### Phase 2: Advanced RAG Features (Medium Priority - 18h)

| Feature | Description | Priority | Effort |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Multi-Thread RAG** | Query across multiple conversation threads | High | 5h |
| **Temporal RAG** | Time-aware retrieval (recent vs historical) | Medium | 4h |
| **User-Specific RAG** | Personalized responses based on user history | Medium | 5h |
| **Code Search RAG** | RAG for code snippets shared in chat | Low | 4h |

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### n8n Setup

**Option A: Self-Hosted (Recommended for submission)**
```bash
# Using Docker
docker run -d \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n
```

**Option B: Cloud (n8n.io)**
- Free tier available
- Easier for demos
- Persistent workflows

**Webhook Integration:**
```typescript
// firebase/functions/src/n8n.ts
import { https } from 'firebase-functions';
import { db } from './firebase-admin';

export const n8nWebhook = https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  const { event, data } = req.body;
  
  // Forward to n8n
  await fetch('https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/message', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ event, data })
  });
  
  res.json({ success: true });
});
```

---

### RAG Implementation

**Vector Store Setup:**
```typescript
// Already have embeddings from semantic search!
// Just need to enhance the retrieval + generation

// 1. Enhanced Retrieval
async function retrieveContext(query: string, limit: number = 5) {
  const embedding = await generateEmbedding(query);
  const results = await vectorSearch(embedding, limit);
  return results.map(r => r.text).join('\n\n');
}

// 2. Augmented Prompt
async function ragQuery(query: string) {
  const context = await retrieveContext(query);
  
  const prompt = `
Context from past conversations:
${context}

User Question: ${query}

Answer based on the context above. If the context doesn't contain the answer, say so.
`;

  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
  });
  
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

**RAG UI Component:**
```typescript
// src/screens/RagAssistantScreen.tsx
export default function RagAssistantScreen() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [response, setResponse] = useState('');
  
  const handleQuery = async () => {
    const result = await ragQuery(query);
    setResponse(result);
  };
  
  return (
    <View>
      <TextInput 
        value={query}
        onChangeText={setQuery}
        placeholder="Ask about past conversations..."
      />
      <Button onPress={handleQuery} title="Ask AI" />
      <Text>{response}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
