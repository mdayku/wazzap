## 🚨 CRITICAL GAPS (62 Points at Risk)

### Gap 1: AI Features Untested (30 points at risk)

**Problem:** All 6 AI features deployed but NEVER tested. If they don't work, you get 0-7/30 points.

| Feature | Cloud Function | UI | Integration | Tested | Risk |
|---------|----------------|----|-----------|---------| -----|
| Thread Summarization | ✅ Deployed | ❌ No button | ❌ Not connected | ❌ No | 🔴 HIGH |
| Action Item Extraction | ✅ Deployed | ❌ No button | ❌ Not connected | ❌ No | 🔴 HIGH |
| Priority Detection | ✅ Deployed | ❌ No badge | ❌ Not connected | ❌ No | 🔴 HIGH |
| Decision Tracking | ✅ Deployed | ✅ Screen exists | 🟡 Partial | ❌ No | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Semantic Search | ✅ Deployed | ✅ Screen exists | 🟡 Partial | ❌ No | 🟡 MEDIUM |
| Proactive Scheduler | ✅ Deployed | ❌ Minimal UI | ❌ Not connected | ❌ No | 🔴 HIGH |

**What's Missing:**
- No AI menu button in ChatScreen

  - ✅ App lifecycle (you've tested)
  - ❌ **All 5 AI features with examples** (CAN'T SHOW - not working)
  - ❌ **Advanced AI capability** (CAN'T SHOW - not working)
  - Brief architecture explanation

**Impact if not submitted:** -15 points

### Gap 3: Persona Brainlift Missing (-10 points)

**Required:**
- 1-page document with:
  - Remote Team Professional persona
  - Pain points being addressed
  - How each AI feature solves a problem
  - Key technical decisions

**Impact if not submitted:** -10 points
