# Archived Documents

These documents were archived because they overstated the project's completion status.

## Why Archived?

The original `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` and `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` were written **aspirationally** - describing what *should* be built rather than what *was actually tested and working*.

They used ‚úÖ checkmarks for features that were:
- Coded but not tested
- Deployed but not verified
- Implemented but not working

This led to confusion about what was actually functional.

## Replacement

**New source of truth:** `../PRODUCT_STATUS.md`

This document uses a clearer system:
- ‚úÖ **WORKING** - Built, tested, and verified
- üü° **CODED** - Built but not tested yet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** - Partially working
- ‚ùå **BLOCKED** - Cannot work due to limitation

## Files Archived

1. `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md.old` - Original implementation tracking (overly optimistic)
2. `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md.old` - Original project summary (claimed 100% complete)

Both are preserved here for reference, but should not be considered accurate.
